# Inferring the Scene Using Wireless Traffics and World Knowledge
With the rise of smart home IoT devices and low-cost wireless sensors, privacy leakage has become a significant concern. In this project, we aim to design an attack methodology that can infer human movement within a specific room by analyzing the wireless traffic from camera sensors combined with world knowledge, thereby demonstrating the serious privacy threats these wireless sensors pose to users.
